# Homeowners Insurance Regulatory Requirements

⚠️ **SYNTHETIC DATA - FOR DEMONSTRATION ONLY**

This document contains entirely synthetic regulatory guidance created for portfolio demonstration purposes.

---

## Overview

This document compiles regulatory requirements applicable to homeowners insurance model development and documentation at ABC Insurance Company. Homeowners models face specific regulatory scrutiny around catastrophe modeling, rate adequacy, and consumer protection.

---

## Section 1: NAIC Model Audit Rule (MAR) - Homeowners Considerations

### 1.1 Property/Casualty Annual Statement Requirements

**Actuarial Opinion Requirements:**
- Statement of Actuarial Opinion on loss and LAE reserves

- Risk of Material Adverse Deviation disclosure

**Homeowners-Specific Considerations:**
- CAT reserve adequacy for hurricane, earthquake, wildfire exposure
- Reinsurance recoverability for catastrophe treaties
- IBNR for late-reported weather events
- Demand surge provisions in reserve estimates

### 1.2 Risk-Based Capital (RBC) Implications

**R4 - Underwriting Risk:**

- Concentration risk for coastal/wildfire exposure

**Catastrophe Risk Charge:**

- Assess model appropriateness for intended purpose
- Evaluate model limitations
- Test and validate model

**Homeowners Model Documentation:**
- Frequency and severity model specifications
- Territory model development
- CAT model integration
