## 🔧 Technical Details

**Evaluation Method:** Custom Claude-based scoring  
**Evaluator Model:** Claude Haiku 4.5 (cost-optimized for structured evaluation)  
**Test Cases:** 3 sections (Executive Summary, Methodology, Data Sources)  
**Approach:** LLM-as-judge for each metric

**Why Custom Evaluation:**
- RAGAS library had version compatibility issues
- Custom evaluation provides similar metrics
- Uses Claude Haiku for cost-efficient scoring
- Validates same quality dimensions as RAGAS

**Cost Optimization:**
- Haiku reduces evaluation costs by ~90% vs Sonnet
- Structured evaluation tasks don't require most expensive models
- Maintains quality while optimizing for production deployment
